# 💝 Valentine's Day Invitation Project

An interactive, romantic web application designed as a digital Valentine's proposal. This project features a playful "dodging" button, a celebration system, and a hidden animated letter.

## 🌟 Features
* **Persistent "No" Button:** A playful mechanism where the "No" button moves randomly and changes its text to "tease" the user into clicking "Yes".
* **Dynamic "Yes" Scaling:** The "Yes" button grows in size with every attempt to click "No," making it the center of attention.
* **Celebration System:** Clicking "Yes" triggers a full-screen confetti effect and switches the view to a successful proposal state.
* **Interactive Envelope:** A CSS-animated envelope that opens upon clicking to reveal a heartfelt, scrollable letter.
* **Atmospheric Audio:** Integrated background music logic that bypasses modern browser autoplay restrictions by triggering on the first user interaction.
* **Floating Decor:** A constant "drop" animation of hearts, teddy bears, and chocolates across the screen.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Animations, Transitions).
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for DOM manipulation and event handling.
* **Fonts:** Crimson Pro and Playfair Display via Google Fonts.
* **Deployment:** Optimized for hosting on platforms like Netlify.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The core structure, containing the proposal interface and the hidden letter content.
* `css/style.css` - Custom styling, including complex envelope animations and the falling "drop" effects.
* `js/script.js` - The logic for button movement, music management, and the success state transition.
* `Love.mp3` - The background audio file (required for the music feature).

## 🚀 Setup & Customization
1.  **Clone/Download:** Save the project folder to your local machine.
2.  **Audio:** Ensure your audio file is named `Love.mp3` in the root directory for the script to detect it.
3.  **Personalize:** Open `index.html` and edit the text inside the `<div class="letter-body">` section to write your own personal message.
4.  **Deploy:** Simply drag and drop the folder into Netlify for instant hosting.
